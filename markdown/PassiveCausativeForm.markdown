The Passive Causative Form
==========================

In English this is analogous to "made to do". This is a wonderful display
of the synthetic nature of Japanese. In essence it is a double conjugation
with the order

- Plain → Causative → Passive Causative

One complication is that group 1 verbs are shortened in modern Japanese.
For this reason ーせられる becomes ーされる.

Example
-------

- "My girlfriend made me wait."
- 「彼女は僕に待た**せた**。」
- "I was made to wait by my girlfriend."
- 「僕は彼女に待た**された**。」

For group 2 verbs the full conjugation must be used.

Example
-------

- "My girlfriend made me eat."
- 「彼女は僕に食べ**させた**。」
- "I was made to eat by my girlfriend."
- 「僕は彼女に食べ**させられた**。」
