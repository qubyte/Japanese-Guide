The Passive Form
================

Sentences become inverted. i.e. the subject and object switch places
in the sentence, and the verb is altered.

Example
-------

In the direct form, one may say:

- "My friend laughed at me."
- 「友達は僕に**笑った**。」

In the passive form, this sentence is:

- "I was laughed at by my friend."
- 「僕は友達に**笑われた**。」

Conjugating the verb
--------------------

The verb conjugates like the ない form. i.e. the verb is plain but ends
on an "a" sound.

- わら**う** → わら**われる**

The result conjugates as a group 2 verb.
