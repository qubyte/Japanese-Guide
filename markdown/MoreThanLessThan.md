# More Than, Less Than

These are simple constructs to describe if subject A has
more or less of a particular quality than B.

## More Than

### Example

- That PC is faster than this PC.
- あのパソコンはこのパソコンより[はや](-早)いです。

The faster PC is the subject, so is marked with a 「は」,
whereas the slower PC is marked with 「より」. To emphasise
that A has more than B, 「は」 may be replaced with
「のほうが」.

- That PC is faster than this PC!
- あのパソコンのほうがこのパソコンより[はや](-早)いです。

## Less Than

### Example

- This PC is not as fast as that PC.
- このパソコンはあのパソコンほど[はや](-早)くない。

This marks the greater with 「ほど」, and the property must
be in the negative form, analogously to the English version.
