Adjectives as Nouns
===================

By the title it isn't immediately clear what the use of this is. Think
of the following conjugations in English

---------- --- -------------
tough       →  toughness
yellow      →  yellowness
important   →  importance
---------- --- -------------

In Japanese these are easy to conjugate. い-adjectives lose the い and
gain a さ. な-adjectives simply have a さ appended.

--------- --- --------------
おいし**い**   →  おいし**さ**
げんき        →  げんき**さ**
--------- --- --------------
