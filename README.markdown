# About

This project, just starting, is to gather my notes on the Japanese language.
For the most part it will deal with **grammar**. Placing this on github allows
it to be checked and added to by the community.

Ultimately I'd like to compile these notes into a reference ebook, or set of
webpages etc.

These notes are written in markdown, and must be compiled with
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) into other formats. This is
necessary because some time custom syntax is used, for example to express
ruby text in a way that can be compiled to multiple output formates.

## Converting these notes to other formats

In order to convert these notes to other formats, they must be piped through
a custom script called `handleRuby.hs`. In the scripts folder are some helper
shell scripts that demonstrate how to use the haskell script.

## Contributing

Before working with these notes, please ping me. I have a massive amount
still to add and duplicating effort is contrary to placing this on github.
