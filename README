This project, just starting, is to gather my notes on the Japanese language.
For the most part it will deal with grammar. Placing this on github allows
it to be checked and added to.

These notes are written in markdown, and should ideally be compiled with
pandoc into other formats.

Before working with these notes, please ping me. I have a massive amount
still to add and duplicating effort is contrary to placing this on github.
